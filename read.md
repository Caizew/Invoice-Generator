# 🧾 FinTrack Invoice Generator

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **multi-format invoice generation system** built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
It demonstrates the use of **abstraction, inheritance, and file generation** across three formats:

- PDF (using `reportlab`)
- Excel (using `openpyxl`)
- HTML (using native file I/O)

Each generator class inherits from an abstract base class `InvoiceGenerator`.
